- Iâ€™m learning to look for the love around me.
- in the speckles of morning sun that peek between the blinds at day rise.
- in my first sip of black coffee.
- in the waves of laughter brought in by the spring air.
---
- I feel a lightness in me
- I'm tracing along its edges with my finger
-  {:.indent-3} *thank you,*
-  {:.indent-4} *thank you,*
-  {:.indent-5} *thank you.*
